### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (AJAX allows the client web pages to quickly interact and exchange data witha  web server without reloading the entire web page. )
2. (One symbol that is very important when using JSON is "key:value". This was helpful in this assignment specifically because there were a lot of keys such as Language and popularity.)
3. (Two other symbols that are necessary for JSON are {}, which is a javascript object or and unordered list of elements. The symbol [], is a javascript array, or an ordered list.)
